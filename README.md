A *Minecraft* Forge mod by rbasamoyai that's far from done I suppose.

The mod focuses on NPC workers that make munitions, weapons, and
other stuff. You can then give these products to combat NPCs who
can fight stuff.

* The mod actually starting up
* An NPC with some brain, can follow instructions
* some cool GUIs

    * NPC occupations
    * NPCs actually doing something
    * Combat NPCs

* Research trees
* Some ores
* Weapons

### Currently working on (or not)
